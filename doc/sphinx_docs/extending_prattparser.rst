Extending the ``PrattParser`` class
===================================

The basic ``PrattParser`` class in Typped comes with many predefined functions
for defining language constructs.  This is sufficient for many simple languages.
To parse more complicated languages, though, it is necessary to extend the
``PrattParser`` class by defining a subclass.  Fortunately, this is not difficult
to do.
