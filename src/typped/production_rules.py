Introduction
------------

This module implements a nice frontend for parsing grammars using EBNF-like
Python expressions.  The backend is the recursive-descent parsing capabilities
of the `PrattParser` class, implemented using precondition functions and
null-string token handlers.

Similar projects which parse a Python grammar using recursive descent (though
without the underlying Pratt parser and calls to it) are:

* **pyparsing** -- Uses Python overloading to define the grammar, similar to
  this module.
  http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/home

* **Parsimonius** -- Passed a string containing the EBNF of the grammar.
  https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious

* **Parsley** -- Passed a string containing the EBNF of the grammar.
  https://github.com/python-parsley/parsley/

* **yeanpypa** -- Uses Python overloading, similar to this module.

Terminology
-----------

TODO: start using caselist as a term.

* **Production rules** are also called **productions**, **parsing rules**,
  or just **rules**.  They are the individual rewrite rules such as
  `<expression> ::= <term>` in a BNF grammar.  The symbols on the l.h.s. of
  productions (which can also appear in the r.h.s.) are called **nonterminal
  symbols**.  The r.h.s of a production is called the **parsing expression**.
  The other possible symbols on the r.h.s. are **terminal symbols** or the
  special **epsilon symbol**.

* Production rules with the the same l.h.s. nonterminal symbol will be
  called different **cases** of the nonterminal symbol.  An alternative
  notation is to define multiple cases in one expression by using "or" symbol
  `|`.  This latter form of definition is currently *required* by this module.
  That is, all the cases of rules defining a nonterminal must be occur in one
  expression, using `|` if there are multiple cases.  The ordered list of all
  the rule cases for a nonterminal will be called the **caselist** for the
  nonterminal.

* The separate symbol elements within a case will be collectively called the
  **items** of that case.  They include terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols,
  and possibly the epsilon symbol.  In this module there are no explicit
  terminal symbols.  Instead, terminals are either tokens (defined for and
  parsed from the lexer) or else consecutive sequences of tokens.  Several
  grammatical constructs are possible to modify the meaning of the items in a
  production rule, which will be discussed later.

The order in which the caselists of production rules are written does not
matter.  So they can be written top-down starting with the starting
nonterminal, or any other convenient way.  Some of the nonterminals in the
r.h.s. of the caselists may not have been defined yet, but they are written as
string labels and are resolved later when the `compile` method of the grammar
is called (passed the start nonterminal and a locals dict).  These r.h.s.
strings for nonterminals **must be identical** to the l.h.s. Python variable
names for the nonterminals (since they are looked up in the locals dict).

The order in which the cases of a nonterminal are defined within a caselist
*does* matter, at least for ambiguous grammars and to avoid or minimize
backtracking.  The order of the cases is the order in which the algorithm will
test the cases.  The first successful parse is returned.  In this sense the
grammar is similar to a **parsing expression grammar (PEG)** rather than a
**context-free grammar (CFG)**, which can be ambiguous.  (PEGs also allow "and"
and "not" predicates which do not consume any input.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

TODO: note that on page above a PEG essentially allows parsing expressions to
contain other parsing expressions, as in `Sum ‚Üê Product (('+' / '-') Product)*`
It does a backtracking until one succeeds or all fail.  Essentially an inlining
of the cases for a sub-rule.  Can ignore, but consider if easily doable.

Implementation
--------------

.. note::

    This module is a work-in-progress.  As of now the syntactic Python
    interface mostly all works, but not all of the features have been coded
    into the backend algorithms.  Currently it does basic BNF types of things,
    but not many EBNF extensions.  See the test file cases for examples.  Here
    is a summary of what is implemented and what is not yet implemented.

    Implemented::

       Backtracking recursive descent search.
       Rule
       Tok

    Not yet implemented::

       Prec and precedences in productions
       Sig type handling
       Pratt calls to the Pratt parser
       Optional
       OneOrMore
       ZeroOrMore
       Not
       AnyOf
       Hide
       Repeat(n, itemlist), exactly n repeats
       overload * as in `3 * k_rpar` for Repeat
       RepeatAtLeast(n, itemlist), n or more repeats
       overload ** as in `3 ** k_rpar` for RepeatAtLeast
       LL(1) optimization
       epsilon production handling
       Undo compile in Grammar class.

       
TODO: Make this a table????

The kinds of items that are supported are:

* rules         Rule, _<"str">_, ItemList var?, probably _<"str" alone
* tokens        tok_name, Tok(tok_name)
* pratt calls   Pratt(<args>)
* dummy         DummyItem(), just set flag.... then _ = DummyItem()

The possible modifiers are:

* prec       int argument assumed a prec.  only for rules?  tokens too?
* root       Anything, wrap with Root(...) helper fun.
* type_sig   Any instance of TypeSig assumed to set it.

Wrapper functions
-----------------

Strings in the rule-defining expressions must be wrapped by some function call,
even though allowing the plains strings would be convenient for rules or for
using token labels instead of the token objects.  That would work in most
cases, but since addition is defined for strings it would not work for two
strings at the beginning of the expression.

Wrapper functions:

=========   =========================== ==========
Function    Arguments                   Shortcut
=========   =========================== ==========
`Rule`      rule-label (string)
`Tok`       token                       token
`Root`      item                        ~item
`Prec`      item, prec                  item[prec]
`Pratt`     (optional) pstate, type sig
`Sig`       item, type sig              item(sig)
=========   =========================== ==========

Overloaded operator API
-----------------------

The basic objects that make up rule definitions are `Item` objects, `ItemList`
objects, and `CaseList` objects.  The latter two are just list-like objects
with most of the list operations overloaded.  An `ItemList` only holds `Item`
instances, and a `CaseList` only holds `ItemList` instances.  These objects
do not nest, and so they have some important differences from ordinary Python
lists.

The `ItemList` and `CaseList` classes are basically designed for concatenation
operations, since that is what is used to build up production rule expressions.
In their constructors they they both take an arbitrary number of arguments.
All the arguments are converted to elements of the single type that they hold.
The new instance then initially contains all those converted arguments as
elements.  When an `ItemList` is passed another `ItemList` in its initializer
argument list it just takes the elements within that list and puts them on its
list.  The `CaseList` class works similarly.

So the initializers basically form the concatenation of all the passed-in
arguments, after converting to the one type that the list-like object holds.
The addition and "or" operations are essentially shorthand for putting both
operands on an initializer list of the appropriate return type.

Addition of `Item` or `ItemList` instances with `+` always returns an
`ItemList`.  The operation is the same as if the operands had both been on the
initializer list for `ItemList`.

The "or" operation `|` on `Item`, `ItemList`, or `CaseList` instances always
returns a `CaseList`.  Again, it is the same as if the operands had been
arguments to the initializer of a `CaseList`.

The `+` and `|` operators are defined for tokens in the `PrattParser` module to
behave in the same way as the `Item` instances.  This allows the use of the
tokens directly, without having to convert them into `Item` instances (via the
`Tok` function).

Since the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `|` operator, all the
additions within a case will always be carried-out before any "or" operations.
So each argument to `|` will be either a single token, a single `Item` or a
single `ItemList`.

Operations such as `append` and `insert` are defined for these list-like
classes.  They convert their argument to the correct type for the container and
then do the expected thing.  Indexing of these list-like objects is also
supported, including negative indices but currently not slices.

Note that after a full expression containing these objects and operators is
evaluated the resulting r.h.s. object (which is set to the l.h.s. variable name
for a production rule) can be 1) a single token, 2) a single `Item`, 3) a
single `ItemList`, or 4) a `CaseList`.  The `compile` method of a `Grammar`
instance will always convert the value into a `CaseList` instance.  (It would
be possible to overload the `<<=` operator and use it instead of `=` to
automatically do the conversion, but that does not seem worth the extra
notation and boilerplate.)

TODO: 

    Update: Implement this: Use `3 * k_digit` for exactly 3, and `3 ** k_digit`
    for three or more.  Then ZeroOrMore is `0**k_digit` and OneOrMore is
    `1**k_digit`.  The `**` operator can be read as `OrMore`.  Both have high
    precedence, shouldn't be a problem!!!  The extra asterisk "adds more" to
    the expression.  Also, `Not` is `0*k_comma`.

    * `*` = "occurrences of"
    * `**` = "or more occurrences of"

    Applies to groups in parens for free; the + operators turn the all
    into an ItemList.

    Implement as `Repeat(n, itemlist)` and `RepeatAtLeast(n, itemlist)`.

    Note, though, that 3*_<"wff">_ will grab the 3*_, which must return
    something that works.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form


A convenient synonym for the `Rule` function
--------------------------------------------

The `<` and `>` operators are also defined so they can be used as a convenient
synonym for the `Rule` function.  Unfortunately, comparison operators have a
precedence lower than both `+` and `|`.  This significantly complicates things.
The definitions perhaps take more effort than they are worth, but it is a good
puzzle.

We want something like this::

    wff = ( _<"egg">_ + k_plus + _<"egg">_
          | _<"egg">_ + k_minus + _<"egg">_
          )

The symbol `_` is assumed to be a reference to a special dummy item.  If that
symbol is not usable for some reason then some letter can be used, say
`o<"wff">o`.  Or just use the `Rule` function instead.

We know that the operators will always appear in the form
`DummyItem<str>DummyItem`, where `DummyItem` is a special kind of item, and
`str` is the string name for a production rule.  We can end up with these cases
and the reflection of each case:

    * Item < str > Item
    * Item < str > ItemList
    * Item < str > CaseList
    * ItemList < str > Item
    * ItemList < str > ItemList
    * ItemList < str > CaseList
    * CaseList < str > Item
    * CaseList < str > ItemList
    * CaseList < str > CaseList

Because the comparison operators have the lowest precedence, they will be the
last thing evaluated and will split the final `CaseList` (like if someone
arbitrarily cut up a string of balanced parentheses).  It is always possible to
uniquely reassemble such a collection of sublists, and the comparison operators
essentially need to do that.

In order for this to work the comparison operators need to be defined for all
three of the classes above.  They need to convert the string in the middle into
the `Item` for an rule and then reassemble the three objects in the correct
way.  We know, for example, that the rightmost `DummyItem` in the left object
needs to join the leftmost `DummyItem` in the right object and be replaced by
the `Item` for a rule corresponding to the string.

There is another potential problem with the comparisons: It is well-known
that comparison operators cannot in general be overloaded to work as
chained operators.  The BDFL rejected PEP 335 for a more-general overloading
system, but suggested in the rejection that he would be open to a PEP
to allow comparison chaining.  As of now, however, that has not been done
(and would not work for older versions if it were).

Fortunately, this case of using chained comparisons is *not* the general case.
The general case fails because `x<y>z` is always equivalent to `x<y and y>z`
with `y` only evaluated once.  The `and` operation is equivalent to `if x is
false, then x, else y` with short-circuiting when `x` is false.  If `x` is
false, then, `y` is never processed or looked at.  But if `x` is always false
then non-chained comparisons are broken.  We, however, don't care about the
boolean values at all in this context.  So the l.h.s. comparisons can always be
true.  We only need to join things together and return the combination.

In this case, since the middle object is a string and the ordering of
operations is fixed.  Only the `<` operation needs to be defined, since the `>`
object will also use that.  (The string type does not have `>` defined for the
type so the reflection will be used, see
https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html).

The algorithm, then works as follows.  The first `<` operator gets a thread
lock and writes its arguments to a global module variable.  The following `>`
appends its arguments to the same list (leaving out duplicates).  This
continues until the `>` operator only has a single dummy `Item` (the symbol
`_`) as its right argument.  In that case the saved data is read, the save
location is cleared, the thread lock is released, and the data is returned.

The rule above for detecting the last `>` in a production expression works
because the `>` symbol has the lowest precedence of any of the operators.
So the rightmost one (say in `_<"wff">_`) *must* have `_` as its r.h.s.
argument.  In every other case the r.h.s. is not an individual `Item`,
since the smallest case is something like `_<"wff">_+_<"wff">_`.  The
middle `_+_` is evaluated to produce an `ItemList`, which is not an `Item`.

Rejected overloads
------------------

TODO: delete this or move to some footnote or something.

**Comma-separated lists for items**
   Instead of combining items with `+`, one could consider combining them with
   `,` by using the definition of tuples.  Then `lhs = k_number, Rule("wff")`
   would set lhs to a tuple.  Unfortunately, `|` is not defined for lists.
   So each production rule would need to be defined on a separate line.

**Raw strings**
    Raw strings cannot be allowed in the rule expressions because `"s" + "s"`
    is defined as concatenation, which would lead to conflict with the current
    use of the `+` operator.  Also, `"s" | "s"` is not defined, which would
    cause special cases needing wrappers.

**Optional with `[...]`**

    Remember that brackets are lists.  So `[k_comma]` could be considered for
    `Optional(k_comma)` This fails in similar ways that commas in tuples
    fail: adding two lists gives the wrong thing, and `|` is not defined for lists.
    A possible alternative would be to use `_[k_comma]`.  This would work by overloading
    indexing on the `_` item, but it has the annoying underscore.  Without `{...}`
    to go with it it doesn't seem too attractive.

**Repeat with `{...}`**

   Usually in EBNF `{...}` is the repeat symbol.  It seems like it would be
   possible to overload the set initialization braces to do this, since the `|`
   operation is union.  But the `+` operator is not defined, leading to
   special cases requiring the wrapper-function `ZeroOrMore`.
   
   As far as `|` being union, you just have to make sure that `Item` instances
   always compare unequal by defining `__bool__` for them.  But it is not just
   `Item` instances that would need to be redefined if undecorated tokens are
   allowed in the expressions.  The `Item` class is special-purpose and is only
   used for these expressions.  Tokens are general-purpose, though, and are
   used in many contexts.  Such a change to their behavior could lead to many
   unexpected consequences.
   
   Another deal-breaker here is expressions like `lhs = k_digit | k_digit`
   which cannot be converted into `Item` instances and which collapse down into
   `lhs = k_digit` in an undetectable way.  Maybe that works, since they *are*
   identical, and any time you add another item you end up with `ItemList`
   instances.  It is at least cause to be wary.

   Since the `*` and `**` operators work well and serve as shorcuts for
   `OneOrMore`, `Optional`, and `ZeroOrMore` the questionable overloads above
   are not used.  

Modifiers for items
-------------------

Items can have several begin/end modifiers to indicate when special processing
starts or ends.  These are stored in a list attribute called
`begin_end_modifiers`.  End modifiers are always the string ")".  Begin
modifiers can be any of these (set by the corresponding function applied to the
Item or ItemList):

* `"Optional("`
* `"OneOrMore("`
* `"ZeroOrMore("`

Operator precedences
--------------------

In order to use Pratt-parser style operator precedences in a grammar two things
must be done.

1. The relevant items in a case of a production must be set to some nonzero
value.

2. The item before the expression (before the first argument) must be wrapped
in a special function.

To see how this works, consider these productions below, parsing the expressions
`x + y * z` (compared with `x * y + z`).

.. code-block:: python

    term = Regex()

    add = Head(Rule("term")) + Rule("operator")

    operator = Tail( k_add[20] + Rule("term")
                   | k_ast[40] + Rule("term")
                   )

1. The `add` production is somehow on the top of the `pstack` and
`recursive_parse(0)` is called.  This invokes the head-handler for the `add`
production (which is a handler for the null-string token with the precondition
that "add" is on top of the stack).

2. The head-handler for the `add` production then pushes `"term"` onto the
`pstack` and calls `recursive_parse(0)` to get the first argument.

3. The head-handler for the `term` rule is then invoked.  It fetches the
first term, which is `x` and returns it as a subtree leaf.

4. We are now back to the `add` handler, having gotten `x` as `processed_left`.
It now pops the `term` state and pushes the `operator` state onto the `pstack`.
It then calls `recursive_parse(0, processed_left)`, which runs as a
tail-handler.  Notice how the recursive descent handler for the `add`
production is essentially mimicking the `recursive_parse` routine but pushing
and popping states.

----> Should the whole loop of recursive_parse run, or just one iteration
      when passed the explicit argument?????  As it is here, just one iteration?
      Could split up the head and tail parts as two functions... each loop
      iteration could be a function (but would be less efficient).

----> Do we need any special wrappers like `Tail`?

5. The tail-handler for `k_add` is now called, since the `+` token was returned
by the lexer.  It pushes the state `term` and calls `recursive_parse(20,
processed_left`.

6. The head-handler for `term` calls `recursive_parse(0)`, which fetches the
token `y`.

7. HERE IS INTERESTING PART, iron out above and figure out how to make it
work...

So the expression `x + y * z` will be evalated as `x + (y*z)`.

Optimizing the grammar
----------------------

predictive parsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to optimize the parsing of a recursive descent grammar, many
grammars allow the use of **predictive parsing**, which requires no
backtracking.  Even when predictive parsing is not possible, often
partial predictive parsing can make the algorithm more efficient
(falling back to backtracking search only when necessary).

To use a predicive parse you need to generate a **first set** for
each non-terminal (i.e., recursive rule call) in the grammar.  Call
this `first_set(nonterminal)`.

When epsilon productions are allowed a **follow set** acts similarly to
a first set.

See:

http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/fall2010/cs340/lecture/lecture9.html
http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~moreno//CS447/Lectures/Syntax.html/node12.html

Maybe also consider packrat parsing:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar#Implementing_parsers_from_parsing_expression_grammars

grammar transformations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not implemented.  Just an idea for now, but you could do any number of
grammar transformations on the rules of a `Grammar` object.

One possibility is to remove at least trivial left recursion.  Just change the
ordering of any obvious left recursive cases.

In a more complicated transformation you could do **left factoring** on the
grammar to remove the left recursion.

Consider curtailment of left recursion, too.  If it is going to repeat will it
repeat in n levels, where that is the number of rules?  What is the limit, etc.
See some of those articles and maybe do a simple thing.
